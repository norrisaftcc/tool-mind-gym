# Pythonic LLM Agent Hive System - Bicameral Architecture

## Why Generators Are Perfect for LLM Agents

For LLM-based agents, **generators and async/await are transcendent abstractions** because:

1. **LLM calls are expensive and async** - you need to yield control while waiting
2. **Bicameral = internal dialogue** - generators naturally model conversational flow
3. **Hive coordination** - async/await handles concurrent agent communication
4. **Token streaming** - generators match how LLMs produce output

## Core Architecture

```python
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncIterator, Dict, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass
import openai  # or anthropic, etc.

@dataclass
class Thought:
    """Internal thought from bicameral process"""
    speaker: str  # "analytical" or "intuitive" 
    content: str
    confidence: float
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]

@dataclass
class Message:
    """Inter-agent communication"""
    from_agent: str
    to_agent: str
    content: str
    thought_chain: List[Thought]
    
class BicameralAgent:
    """An agent with two internal voices"""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, analytical_prompt: str, intuitive_prompt: str):
        self.name = name
        self.analytical = AnalyticalVoice(analytical_prompt)
        self.intuitive = IntuitiveVoice(intuitive_prompt)
        self.memory = ConversationMemory()
        self.peers = {}  # Other agents in the hive
        
    async def think(self, stimulus: str) -> AsyncIterator[Thought]:
        """Bicameral thinking process using generators"""
        
        # Initial intuitive reaction
        async for thought in self.intuitive.react(stimulus):
            yield thought
            
        # Analytical critique
        intuitive_thoughts = self.memory.recent_thoughts("intuitive")
        async for thought in self.analytical.analyze(intuitive_thoughts):
            yield thought
            
        # Dialectical resolution
        async for thought in self._synthesize():
            yield thought
    
    async def converse(self, message: Message) -> AsyncIterator[Message]:
        """Handle incoming messages with bicameral processing"""
        
        # Internal deliberation
        thoughts = []
        async for thought in self.think(message.content):
            thoughts.append(thought)
            
            # Stream partial responses
            if thought.confidence > 0.8:
                response = Message(
                    from_agent=self.name,
                    to_agent=message.from_agent,
                    content=thought.content,
                    thought_chain=thoughts.copy()
                )
                yield response
        
        # Final response after full deliberation
        final_response = await self._formulate_response(thoughts)
        yield final_response
```

## The Generator Advantage for LLMs

```python
async def analytical_voice_generator(prompt: str, context: List[str]) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """Analytical voice as a generator - perfect for streaming LLM responses"""
    
    # System prompt for analytical thinking
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "\n".join(context)}
    ]
    
    # Stream tokens from LLM
    async for chunk in await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages,
        stream=True
    ):
        token = chunk.choices[0].delta.get('content', '')
        yield token
        
        # Can process/filter/enhance tokens in flight
        if contains_insight(token):
            yield f"[INSIGHT: {token}]"

class AnalyticalVoice:
    def __init__(self, base_prompt: str):
        self.prompt = base_prompt
        self.token_buffer = []
        
    async def analyze(self, context: List[Thought]) -> AsyncIterator[Thought]:
        """Generate analytical thoughts"""
        
        # Convert thoughts to context
        context_strs = [f"{t.speaker}: {t.content}" for t in context]
        
        # Stream analysis
        full_response = ""
        async for token in analytical_voice_generator(self.prompt, context_strs):
            full_response += token
            
            # Yield thoughts as they form (sentence by sentence)
            if token in '.!?':
                thought = Thought(
                    speaker="analytical",
                    content=full_response.strip(),
                    confidence=calculate_confidence(full_response),
                    metadata={"tokens": len(full_response.split())}
                )
                yield thought
                full_response = ""
```

## Hive Coordination with Async/Await

```python
class AgentHive:
    """Coordinate multiple bicameral agents"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents: Dict[str, BicameralAgent] = {}
        self.message_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        self.thought_stream = asyncio.Queue()
        
    async def add_agent(self, agent: BicameralAgent):
        """Add agent to hive"""
        self.agents[agent.name] = agent
        
        # Agents share the hive context
        for other_name, other_agent in self.agents.items():
            if other_name != agent.name:
                agent.peers[other_name] = other_agent
                other_agent.peers[agent.name] = agent
    
    async def broadcast_thought(self, thought: Thought, origin: str):
        """Broadcast significant thoughts to all agents"""
        tasks = []
        for name, agent in self.agents.items():
            if name != origin and thought.confidence > 0.7:
                task = agent.think(f"Peer insight from {origin}: {thought.content}")
                tasks.append(task)
        
        # All agents think in parallel
        async for thoughts in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
            async for thought in thoughts:
                await self.thought_stream.put(thought)
    
    async def collective_decision(self, question: str) -> str:
        """Hive makes a decision through parallel deliberation"""
        
        # All agents consider the question simultaneously
        deliberations = []
        for agent in self.agents.values():
            deliberations.append(
                self._collect_thoughts(agent.think(question))
            )
        
        # Gather all thoughts
        all_thoughts = []
        for thoughts in await asyncio.gather(*deliberations):
            all_thoughts.extend(thoughts)
        
        # Synthesize collective response
        return await self._synthesize_consensus(all_thoughts)
    
    async def _collect_thoughts(self, thought_generator):
        """Helper to collect all thoughts from a generator"""
        thoughts = []
        async for thought in thought_generator:
            thoughts.append(thought)
        return thoughts
```

## Why This Design is Optimal for LLM Agents

### 1. **Natural Token Streaming**
```python
async def streaming_bicameral_response(agent, prompt):
    """Stream thoughts as they emerge"""
    analytical_buffer = ""
    intuitive_buffer = ""
    
    async for thought in agent.think(prompt):
        if thought.speaker == "analytical":
            analytical_buffer += thought.content + " "
        else:
            intuitive_buffer += thought.content + " "
        
        # Yield partial synthesis
        yield {
            "partial_response": synthesize(analytical_buffer, intuitive_buffer),
            "confidence": thought.confidence
        }
```

### 2. **Concurrent Multi-Agent Reasoning**
```python
async def hive_reasoning_session(hive: AgentHive, problem: str):
    """Multiple agents reason together"""
    
    # Phase 1: Independent thinking
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        for agent in hive.agents.values():
            tg.create_task(agent.think(problem))
    
    # Phase 2: Cross-pollination
    significant_thoughts = await hive.get_significant_thoughts()
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        for thought in significant_thoughts:
            tg.create_task(hive.broadcast_thought(thought))
    
    # Phase 3: Convergence
    consensus = await hive.collective_decision(problem)
    return consensus
```

### 3. **Resource-Efficient LLM Calls**
```python
class ThoughtCache:
    """Cache and reuse LLM reasoning"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        
    async def get_or_generate(self, key: str, generator_func):
        if key in self.cache:
            # Replay cached thoughts
            for thought in self.cache[key]:
                yield thought
        else:
            # Generate and cache new thoughts
            thoughts = []
            async for thought in generator_func():
                thoughts.append(thought)
                yield thought
            self.cache[key] = thoughts
```

### 4. **Bicameral Internal Dialogue**
```python
async def bicameral_dialogue(agent: BicameralAgent, rounds: int = 3):
    """Internal dialogue between analytical and intuitive"""
    
    conversation = []
    last_speaker = "intuitive"
    
    for round in range(rounds):
        if last_speaker == "intuitive":
            prompt = "Respond analytically to: " + conversation[-1] if conversation else "Begin"
            async for thought in agent.analytical.analyze([]):
                conversation.append(thought.content)
                yield ("analytical", thought)
            last_speaker = "analytical"
        else:
            prompt = "Respond intuitively to: " + conversation[-1]
            async for thought in agent.intuitive.react(prompt):
                conversation.append(thought.content)
                yield ("intuitive", thought)
            last_speaker = "intuitive"
```

## Complete Example: Research Hive

```python
async def create_research_hive():
    """Create a hive for collaborative research"""
    
    hive = AgentHive()
    
    # Create specialized agents
    historian = BicameralAgent(
        name="Historian",
        analytical_prompt="You analyze historical patterns and precedents with rigor.",
        intuitive_prompt="You sense historical rhymes and narrative threads."
    )
    
    futurist = BicameralAgent(
        name="Futurist", 
        analytical_prompt="You extrapolate trends using systematic analysis.",
        intuitive_prompt="You envision possible futures through creative leaps."
    )
    
    critic = BicameralAgent(
        name="Critic",
        analytical_prompt="You identify logical flaws and inconsistencies.",
        intuitive_prompt="You sense what feels wrong or incomplete."
    )
    
    synthesizer = BicameralAgent(
        name="Synthesizer",
        analytical_prompt="You find connections between disparate ideas.",
        intuitive_prompt="You feel the gestalt of emerging understanding."
    )
    
    # Add to hive
    for agent in [historian, futurist, critic, synthesizer]:
        await hive.add_agent(agent)
    
    return hive

# Usage
async def research_question(question: str):
    hive = await create_research_hive()
    
    print(f"Researching: {question}")
    
    # Stream the hive's thinking process
    async for thought in hive.collective_think(question):
        print(f"[{thought.speaker}@{thought.agent}]: {thought.content}")
    
    # Get final consensus
    answer = await hive.collective_decision(question)
    print(f"\nConsensus: {answer}")
```

## Why Pythonic > SICP-style for LLM Agents

1. **Async is essential** - LLM calls are network I/O
2. **Generators match token streaming** - Natural fit
3. **Decorators for prompt engineering** - Clean abstraction
4. **Context managers for conversation scope** - Perfect for managing context windows
5. **Type hints for LLM schemas** - Structured outputs

The Pythonic approach isn't just convenient here - it's the natural way to model LLM agent systems. The abstractions align perfectly with the problem domain.
