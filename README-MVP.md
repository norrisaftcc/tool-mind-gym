# Mind Gym - Brutal MVP

## What Is This?

This is the **brutal MVP** of Mind Gym - proof that a bicameral AI system can produce genuine insights through internal dialogue. 

**One file. 300 lines. No frameworks.**

## Why Build This First?

We had 23 GitHub issues and weeks of planned architecture. But the core question remained: **Does bicameral dialogue actually work?**

This MVP answers that question in 2 days instead of 3 weeks.

## How It Works

```python
Intuitive Mind (fast, creative) → 
    ↓
Analytical Mind (slow, logical) →
    ↓  
Internal Dialogue (they debate) →
    ↓
Synthesis (unified insight)
```

With a somatic layer (emotional governor) that modulates thinking based on stress and coherence.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install minimal dependencies
pip install anthropic python-dotenv

# Add your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Run it
python mind_gym_mvp.py
```

## What You'll See

```
🧠💪 MIND GYM - Brutal MVP
================================

💭 [Intuitive]: Like water finding its level...
   ↳ Stress: ▓▓▓

🔍 [Analytical]: Examining the structural components...
   ↳ Tension: ▓▓▓▓

💭 [Intuitive]: But structure emerges from flow...
🔍 [Analytical]: Flow requires underlying constraints...

✨ SYNTHESIS:
The interplay between fluid creativity and structured analysis...
```

## Key Insights From Building This

1. **It works** - The bicameral dialogue produces genuinely interesting synthesis
2. **Somatic feedback matters** - Stress levels affect quality of thinking  
3. **Less is more** - 300 lines does what we planned in 30+ issues
4. **Patterns emerge** - We can see what framework we actually need

## What's Next?

If this MVP proves valuable:
1. Extract the patterns that work
2. Build proper abstractions (Nodes, Flows)
3. Add PNG visualization
4. Implement dream states
5. Create MCP server

But only AFTER we know the core concept works.

## Compared to Original Plan

| Original Plan | Brutal MVP | 
|--------------|------------|
| 3 weeks | 2 days |
| 30+ issues | 1 file |
| PocketFlow framework | Direct implementation |
| Complex architecture | Simple async functions |
| Theoretical patterns | Proven patterns |

## Lessons Learned

- **Build first, architect second** when exploring novel concepts
- **300 lines of working code > 3000 lines of plans**
- **The core innovation should be tested immediately**
- **Frameworks emerge from understanding, not planning**

## Try These Queries

1. "What is happiness?" - Simple, philosophical
2. "How does consciousness emerge?" - Complex, deep
3. "Design a new musical instrument" - Creative, open-ended

Watch how the two minds approach each differently!
