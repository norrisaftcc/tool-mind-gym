## Experiment Title
<!-- Give your experiment a descriptive name -->

## Hypothesis
<!-- What do you expect to observe or prove? -->

## Background
<!-- Why is this experiment important? What cognitive aspect are we exploring? -->

## Experiment Design

### Test Queries
<!-- List the specific queries or prompts to test -->
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Parameters to Vary
<!-- What settings will you change between tests? -->
- [ ] Temperature:
- [ ] Max tension time:
- [ ] Dialogue rounds:
- [ ] Somatic thresholds:
- [ ] Other:

### Control Variables
<!-- What stays constant across all tests? -->
- 
- 

### Measurement Criteria
<!-- How will you measure success or observe behavior? -->
- [ ] Dialogue coherence score
- [ ] Synthesis quality
- [ ] Time to insight
- [ ] PNG pattern stability
- [ ] Somatic state progression
- [ ] Other:

## Expected Outcomes
<!-- What patterns or behaviors do you expect to see? -->

### Best Case
<!-- What would ideal cognitive behavior look like? -->

### Worst Case
<!-- What problematic behaviors might emerge? -->

### Most Likely
<!-- What do you realistically expect? -->

## Data Collection Plan
<!-- How will you collect and analyze results? -->
- Log files to capture:
